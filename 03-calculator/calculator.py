# ask the user for number 1
#     convert to a float and round to 4 decimal places
#     if it's not a float print 'INVALID NUMBER' and exit



# ask the user for number 2
#     convert to a float and round to 4 decimal places
#     if it's not a float print 'INVALID NUMBER' and exit



# ask the user for an operator
#     if it's not '+', '-', 'x' or '/' print 'INVALID OPERATOR' and exit



# use if/elif/else to do the right steps based on the operator
#     calculate an answer using +, -, *, or /
#     round the answer to 4 decimal places
#     if the operator is `/`, use exception handling around the division
#       if  to catch an error, set the answer to `ERROR``



# finally print the full equation with the answer
