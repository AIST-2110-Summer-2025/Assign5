# Assignment 5: Additional Conditionals

In this weekâ€™s assignment, you will practice using nested conditionals and
exception handling. You will also get practice using f-strings to format strings
and numbers without using concatenation.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand and apply nested conditional statements.
2. Implement robust input validation using bounds checks and exception handling.
3. Use try-except blocks to handle other types of runtime errors outside of
   input validation.
4. Use f-strings to embed one or more formatted variable values into a single
   string value.

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is structured into the following exercise folders under the root
folder `assn-5-yourusername/`:

- `01-grade`
- `02-leap`
- `03-calculator`

Each directory contains specific tasks that you need to complete.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior
assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each
time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference
[PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) to see the details if you have forgotten.

In summary:

  1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions
  2. Run the scripts to test and debug
  3. Execute the automated tests to ensure expected functionality

When finished, do not forget to:

1. Commit and Sync:
    - Switch to version control tab
    - Stage all changed files
    - _**Enter a commit message**_
    - Click Commit
    - Click Sync
2. Validate your submission in GitHub
3. Submit the final commit ID in D2L
